-   Watch the lecture from 37:25 to 1:01:56. We will cover this material in class as well, so you can skip this portion unless you miss class or need reinforcement of the concepts. In-class slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15GbqON78q_-7_2NXb4Ctu0dGlAQt7wc6FvuRk6axeMQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Questions

-   Answer these questions (submit on Classroom):
    -   Describe the Bubble Sort algorithm in your own words (English/pseudocode).
    -   Describe the Selection Sort algorithm in your own words (English/pseudocode).
    -   Describe the Insertion Sort algorithm in your own words (English/pseudocode).
    -   Which Big-O values are considered a "reasonable" run time and which aren't?

## Problem: Selection

- Implement a program in C in a file named `selection.c` which accepts any number of random integers as arguments and sorts them using the selection sort algorithm ([pdf]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdfs/selection_sort.pdf) \| [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hH8kTHFw2A)). Your program should print the array each time it makes a change to it (i.e. swapping two elements). 
    -   Execute `wget https://cs-acs.com/assets/source_code/selection.c` to download this problemâ€™s distribution code.
    -   You will only write the `selection_sort()` function and should not need to modify any of the other distribution code, though all that matters in the end is that it passes the check50 checks.
    -   You don't have to handle any errors other than what is already implemented in the distribution code.
    -   You can assume that all arguments will be positive or negative integers. 
    -   Your program should only print when it swaps elements, so if you give it an array that is already sorted, it will print nothing.

```
$ ./selection 5

```
$ ./selection -5 10 30 1 5 9 8
