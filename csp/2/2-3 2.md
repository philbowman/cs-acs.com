### Watch the Chapter 2 lecture from 1:09:54 to 1:35:00 and answer the questions below.
1. How is a string like an array?
2. How is a character stored in memory (RAM)? What is ACTUALLY stored there?
3. How do you convert a char from uppercase to lowercase? What's the hard way and what's the easy way?

Submit to Google Classroom.

## 'Letters' Specification
Implement a program in C (use the [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/)) in a file called `letters.c` that does the following:
- Get a string from the user
- Print the # of characters in the string including spaces
- Print the # of letters in the phrase (uppercase and lowercase)\*
- Print the # of words.\* For these purposes, a word is only separated from other words by a single space. You can assume that any input given will not start or end with a space or contain groups of spaces (2 or more in a row).
- Print the average word length (# of characters per word---round to 3 decimal places)
- Print the input phrase with __only__ the first letter of each word capitalized. All other letters should be lowercase even if they were upper in the input phrase.\*

 \*write a function for each of these
