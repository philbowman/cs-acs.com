# Chapter 2.3: `Cash2`

{% include cs50player.html id=page.videoId timestamp=page.timestamp %}

### Watch the Chapter 2 lecture from 1:35:00 to 1:43:00 and answer the questions below.
1. What is `int argc`?
2. What is `string argv[]`
3. What does the `'int` signify in the line `int main(void)`? Why is it there?

Submit to Google Classroom.

## 'Cash2 Specification'
Implement a program in a file in C (use the [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/)) called `cash2.c` that does the same thing as `cash.c` from Chapter 1, with the following modifications: 
-	The program should take a command line argument instead of `get_float()`. 
-	Instead of rejecting and re-prompting when an invalid input (anything other than a single float) is received, the program should inform the user why the input was invalid and exit with an _exit code_ of `1`. If the program executes successfully, it should exist with an _exit code_ of `0`. 
-	You'll need to convert the argument, which is a string, using `[atof()](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_atof.htm)` in order for the rest of your program to work. If `atof()` cannot convert (i.e. the user enters letters instead of numbers), it will return `0.0`. If there are invalid characters after a float, `atof()` will ignore them.
