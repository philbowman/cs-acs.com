# SEMESTER PROJECT RUBRIC

## Criteria
### _Product_
* Takes an input
* Produces an output
* Is accessible in a public GitHub repository
* Includes a LICENSE
* includes a README
* Has a clear purpose explained in the README
* Its functionality is clearly explained through documentation 
* Runs as intended without error 
* Performs complex operations that could not easily be done without a computer


### _Expertise_
  * Includes original algorithms
      - Includes student-developed algorithms that process data using logical or mathematical operations beyond built-in, library, or API calls
      - At least one algorithm employs sequencing, selection, and iteration
      - That algorithm is encapsulated in a function that takes an argument and returns a value that depends on that argument
      - That function is called from elsewhere in the program 
      - That functions helps to manage complexity of the program
      - All of the above is correctly identified and explained in the README
  * Employs selection
      - At least 5 conditionals (`if`, `switch`, and/or `try`)
      - Included conditionals are important to the program's purpose or function
  * Employs iteration
      - At least 3 loops (`while` and/or `for`)
      - Included loops are important to the program's purpose or function
  * Employs procedural abstraction
     - At least 4 functions (`def` or `[type] [name] [parameters]` (if using C))
     - At least 2 `return` and `([parameters])` for separate functions
      - At least 1 function call for EACH function
      - Included functions successfully manage the complexity in the program
  * Employs data abstraction
      - At least 2 data collection types (array or struct (if using c) or list, dictionary, tuple, class, or class (if using python))
      - The data in the included collections is accessed in the program
      - The abstraction helps to manage complexity in the program
      - All of the above is correctly identified and explained in the README

### _Process_
  * Is well documented
      - Includes a video of the program running
      - Includes multiple comments
  * Consistent commit history (~1 per class period) over the last 4 weeks of the project
  * At least one "breakthrough moment" is identified and explained in the README


## Grading
For each category (Product, Expertise, & Process), You'll receive a single grade:

|A|B|C|D|F|I|
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
|Demonstrates creativity and/or sophistication in satisfying the criteria as described in the [grading policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WvPjyZKi5TZ3InDZQmuWHDAYWtpaHQwqWliwacGAkNM/edit?usp=sharing). | Satisfies every aspect of the criteria | Partially satisfies the criteria | Demonstrates only basic understanding or skill as described in the criteria. | Shows little or none of the understanding described in the criteria | Incomplete or insufficient evidence |
